<h1 id="center">My CS50x Experience, and how I learned to program</h1>
<div id="white">
	<p id="smaller">CS50x. The broad range of emotions you go through when you're doing CS50x are kind of unexplainable, in a way. It gave me my love for computer science though, and I had a great time doing CS50. From the very first problem set, there was always a element of surprise, what you knew and what you did not know, combined into one problem set. The problem sets were not easy, and they did give me a fair set of challenges. However, this article isn't going to talk about the problem sets. It is going to talk about my experience doing CS50x, from the beginning to the end, or from start to finish.</p>
	<p id="smaller">So, it all started with seeing someone hacking in a movie, and on seeing that I wondered, 'What if I could do that?'.I was pretty sure Computer Science wasn't going to be like that, and I had done some programming before. But, thanks to the terrible, dry curriculum of Computer Science that awaited me at school, I hated it. I mean, seriously. Computer Science was introduced to us as this subject where people say the word 'logic' a lot, and solve these problems which didn't require using your brain. I don't speak for all schools, but at least mine. The first three weeks did come to me as a big surprise because of that, where we tackled problems based on algorithms and arrays, with the first problem set being a fun little Mario game. On this, I realized that computer science is so much more than programming. It needs to be 'supplemented' with logic, pseudo code and so much more. The last weeks that followed after were a complete blur, and confusion started to kick in faster than a Cheetah. How? Why? What?  This stage became much more intense, and I was forced to spend hours brainstorming possible solutions in my head. This is when I turned to Reddit, and the r/cs50 community helped me immensely, and got me back on my feet. After sleepless nights and my brain crashing, I finally progressed to week 7, A giant relief for me. After that, everything got much more clear, and I knew what my strength was. It was web developing. I then embarked on my final project, hoping to build a beautiful website, and I luckily found a teammate who would help me, and thanks to that,  I am now the author of Schoolvid19, which I built using Flask, HTML and CSS, with my fellow teammate @t0dd, whom you can find on Discord. In conclusion, CS50 found a part of me which I had never known, and I am forever grateful. Quoting Professor David J. Malan, "What ultimately matters in this course is not so much where you end up relative to your classmates, but where you end up relative to yourself." Looking at this, I think I've definitely come a long way from where I was. </p>
